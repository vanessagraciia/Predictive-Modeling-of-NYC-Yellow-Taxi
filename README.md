## README 
**Research Goal:** My research goal is demand analysis on yellow taxi to predict demand based on pick-up location, pick-up hour, pick-up day, and temperature in that day.

**Timeline:** The timeline for the research area is January 2022 - December 2022.

To run the pipeline, please visit the `notebooks` directory and run the files in order:
1. `download.ipynb`: This downloads the raw data (taxi data, weather, and location shape file) into the `data/landing` directory.
2. `preprocessing.ipynb`: This notebook details all preprocessing steps and outputs it to the `data/raw` and `data/curated` directory.
3. `analysis_and_model.ipynb`: This notebook is used to conduct analysis on the curated data and run the model.
